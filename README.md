# Secure-Message-Transmission

# Description:
An application software named secure message transmission is developed for transmission of messages between sender and receiver.

# Overview:
Following steps can be followed for implementation:

1. Message encryption at Sender side:
Encyption: Conversion of message into raw format means no longer available for the third person. It can be done using cryptography key.
Key will have a password which can be used to convert message into raw data (which will not be present in the readable form).

2. Message decryption at Receiver side:
Decryption: Conversion of message from raw to readable format so that receiver can get the actual meaning of the message. this also can be done with the help of same cryptography key. The same password need to share with receiver to get the original form of message.

# Cryptography key : (AES.java)
The above file have cryptography key two methods encrypt and decrypt can be used for encryption and decryption of message using secret key.
secret key is (ssshhhhhhhhhhh!!!!).

# File: (SenderWindow.java)
The above file contain the code of Sender window which will be display in the sender side. sender can encrypt message using above mentioned secret key.

# File: (ReceiverWindow.java)
The above file contain the code of Receiver window whic will be display in the receiver side. Receiver decrypt message using the same 
mentioned secret key.

# File: (.jar extension)
Both files with .jar extension are executable file.
Files with .jar extension can be used for directly execute main class file code without any IDE.
Every application software delivers to the client with .jar file.

# Implementation:
Implemented using Java programming language only, no other programming language required for implementation.

# Requirements:
- Core programming 
- GUI programming 
- Networking
