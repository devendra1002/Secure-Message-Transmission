# Secure-Message-Transmission

# Description:
An application software named secure message transmission is developed for transmission of messages between sender and receiver.

# Overview:
Following steps can be followed for implementation:

1. Message encryption at Sender side:
Encyption: Conversion of message into raw format means no longer available for the third person. It can be done using cryptography key.
Key will have a password which can be used to convert message into raw data (which will not be present in the readable form).

2. Message decryption at Receiver side:
Decryption: Conversion of message from raw to readable format so that receiver can get the actual meaning of the message. this also can be done with the help of same cryptography key. The same password need to share with receiver to get the original form of message.
